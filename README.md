Overview:

  This repository provides clean and well-documented Python implementations of essential data structures and algorithms. 
  Each implementation is carefully curated, optimized, and includes comments to help you understand the inner workings. 
  This collection is ideal for students, developers, and anyone preparing for coding interviews.




Implemented Data Structures ::




The following data structures are implemented in this repository:

  -> Arrays
  
  -> Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, and Circular)
  
  -> Stacks
  
  -> Queues
  
  -> Hash Tables
  
  -> Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, etc.)
  
  -> Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
  
  -> Graphs (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix, Graph Traversals)
  
  -> Tries
  
  








Implemented Algorithms ::



 
The repository also contains implementations of various algorithms, including but not limited to:


 * Sorting Algorithms:


   -> Bubble Sort
   
   -> Insertion Sort

   -> Selection Sort
   
   -> Merge Sort
   
   -> Quick Sort

   -> Heap Sort
   
   -> Counting Sort



 * Searching Algorithms:



   -> Linear Search
  
   -> Binary Search
  
   -> Depth-First Search (DFS)
  
   -> Breadth-First Search (BFS)

  

 * Dynamic Programming:


 
   -> Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

   -> Knapsack Problem
  
   -> Fibonacci Series
  
   -> Coin Change Problem



 * Graph Algorithms:


   -> Dijkstra's Algorithm
  
   -> Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
  
   -> Prim's and Kruskal's Algorithms




Getting Started:



  To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:




Prerequisites:


  Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from python.org.




Installation: 

 

   1. Clone the repository:
     git clone https://github.com/Kaif999/Implement-all-Data-Structures-and-algorithms-in-python.git



   2. Navigate to the project directory:
     cd Implement-all-Data-Structures-and-algorithms-in-python



   3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`



   4. Install any dependencies (if applicable):
      pip install -r requirements.txt



     
Usage:


   Each data structure and algorithm is contained within its own file/folder and can be executed independently. 
   You can run any Python file to see the implementation in action.


 
For example:


    python sorting/quick_sort.py


   Each file contains sample input data and demonstrates how the implementation works. 
   Feel free to modify the input and experiment!




Contributing:


   Contributions are welcome! If you would like to improve or add new data structures or algorithms, 




please follow these steps:


  -> Fork the repository.

  -> Create a new branch
  
     (git checkout -b feature/YourFeature).
  
  -> Commit your changes
  
    (git commit -m 'Add your feature').
  
 ->  Push to the branch
  
    (git push origin feature/YourFeature).
  
 ->  Open a Pull Request.
